# Quantum Teleportation

## About

The file 'QuantumTeleportation.ipynb' contains an interactive walkthrough to some of the concepts and applications of quantum teleportation. Each of the quantum circuits were constructed by utilizing IBMâ€™s Qiskit software, a free and easy to use Python package (see below for installation)

## Installation

To ensure the code in the notebook runs smoothly, please make sure to install the following packages:

```bash
pip install qiskit
pip install numpy
```

## Interested in More?

While it isn't necessary, I highly recommend creating an IBMid account by going to https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/ and signing up for a free account. There are a ton of free resources to learn more about quantum computing. An account also grants access to test your own code on some of IBM's low qubit quantum computers!
